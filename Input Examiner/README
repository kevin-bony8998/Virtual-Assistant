This module is used to break down the users input so that synonyms may also be used in the user input. 

Eg: "Make a note..." = "Create a note..."

The pre-trained model seems to perform marginally better than the self-trained model. However, neither model
can be used for the purpose at hand since both models calculate similarity score based on word usage/context
and not the actual meaning of the word.

Eg: "go" and "come" have an extremely high similarity score even though they have opposite meanings since 
the usage of both words are extremely similar. 

Two possible solutions to this problem are: 

1. Register antonyms. We calculate word similarity and deduct scores severely for words that are anotnyms. 
However, this can be a tedious process and the score to be deducted has a huge impact on the model since 
we are no longer handling contextual word analysis (what either of the two models are meant to do).

2. Register synonyms and scrap the model idea completely(since the model cannot be trusted to provide 
efficient results in it's current state). However, this would mean that the program would depend entirely and 
solely on the vocabulary of words we have introduced. This would also mean that we have a large collection
of words, meaning an extremely large file that the program would have to go through for most words that are 
fed as input. 

Further action is necessary and this module cannot be used properly in the making of "Hades" as is.


UPDATE: It is found that the "synonym_finder" file is able to accomplish the necessary task although it did 
extra words that appear to have no relation to the word parsed as the argument.

Eg: "make" = ['realise', 'establish', 'wee', 'hold', 'brand', 'ready', 'ca-ca', 'piddle', 'pass_water', 
'take_a_crap', 'progress_to', 'nominate', 'throw', 'pee', 'make', 'urinate', 'spend_a_penny', 'take', 
'seduce', 'induce', 'do', 'construct', 'piss', 'pretend', 'make_believe', 'hit', 'relieve_oneself', 
'puddle', 'make_water', 'arrive_at', 'reach', 'fix', 'bring_in', 'micturate', 'take_a_leak', 'score', 
'cause', 'shuffling', 'give', 'attain', 'pee-pee', 'create', 'produce', 'gain', 'cook', 'make_up', 'work', 
'shuffle', 'prepare', 'crap', 'earn', 'clear', 'take_a_shit', 'lay_down', 'realize', 'build', 'have', 
'pull_in', 'constitute', 'stool', 'get_to', 'defecate', 'shit', 'get', 'name', 'take_in', 'wee-wee', 
'form', 'stimulate', 'draw']

In order to remove the extra words, a pre-trained gensim model was used however, the results were not 
accurate enough ("make" and "create" weren't shown to be synonyms with an 'if' similarity score of 0.8) and 
thus was removed.

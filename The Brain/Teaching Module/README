This program works on the ability of the assistant to teach the user whatever it is that the user has requested to learn. The program works by first finding the 
extractive summary of the text extracted from the internet and then using the speech-to-text module to convey the summary to the user so that the user gets the relevant
information in the minimum time possible.

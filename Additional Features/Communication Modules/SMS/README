Both modules work and can send sms'.

However, use them during different occasions. 

The twilio sender makes use of a phone number different from the one we use. Therefore, use this when using 
the actual number is not feasible (when in danger, etc.). The twilio sender has more balance left in the 
trial account balance as well, thereby enabling the sending of more text messages (a full trial account 
balance can afford the sending of 1550 messages). However, the twilio sender can only send messages to TWILIO 
VERIFIED PHONE NUMBERS. This is a major drawback and one that cannot be overcome by any means other than 
by buying a full-fledged twilio number which is expensive. 

The fast2sms sender makes use of our current number and is reliable and feasible. It can send messages to 
any desired number as well. However, the account balance is extremely limited (a full trial account balance 
can afford the sending of only 250 messages).

This is the emailing system of Hades. 

Both codes can work for both yahoo and gmail accounts (can actually work for (presumably) any email service
but only these have been mentioned since they concern us the most). Following are the revisions to be made 
for each of the codes to work for a particular mailing service: 

The "mail_reader" program: 

- For the yahoo account: 
  - Change ORG_EMAIL to "@yahoo.com"
  - Change FROM_EMAIL to "<yahoo_id>"
  - Change FROM_PWD to "<unique_password>"
  - Change SMTP_SERVER to "export.imap.mail.yahoo.com"
  - Change SMTP_PORT to "993"

- For the gmail account: 
  - Change ORG_EMAIL to "@gmail.com"
  - Change FROM_EMAIL to "<gmail id>"
  - Change FROM_PWD to "<password>"
  - Change SMTP_SERVER to "imap.gmail.com"
  - Change SMTP_PORT to "993"

The "mailer" program: 

- For the yahoo account:
  - Change first argument to "smtp.mail.yahoo.com"
  - Change second argument to "465"
  - Change third argument to "<yahoo id>"
  - Change fourth argument to "<password>"

- For the gmail account:
  - Change first argument to "smtp.gmail.com"
  - Change second argument to "587"
  - Change third argument to "<gmail id>"
  - Change fourth argument to "<password>"
